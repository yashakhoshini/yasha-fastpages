#### Strings
- series of characters (numbers, letters, etc), one example of a string is your name or your id because strings can contain both numbers and letters.

#### Lists
- sequences of elements with each element being a variable. An example of a list can be the names of the students in this classroom. 

#### What is an algorithms?
- An algorithm is a finite set of instruction that accomplish a task, it can be expressed by natural language, diagrams, and various other ways.

#### What are the three parts of an algorithm?
- Sequencing, selection, and iteration.

- Every algorithm can be created by a mixture of sequencing, selection, and iteration

#### Sequence?
- A sequence is the order of how to do something to achieve a result, similarly to how you follow the instructions from a teacher. 

#### Selection?
- A selection allows an algorithm to make a decision based on if a condition is met, an example of this is when your car is out of fuel, you go to the gas station to fill your car, but if your car is full you wouldn't go to the gas station.

#### Iteration?
- An iteration is a loop and doing something again until a condition is met, like you put away your computer when you are finished with your work.

#### Substring?
- A substring is part of an existing string

#### If statement
- if proved true, performs a function

#### Variable
-  a value that can change depending on the conditions

#### Jupyter
- lets you write and run code at the same time

#### Push/Pull
- to send / recieve code to and from Github

#### Markdown
- syntac used to format plain text

#### Define
- defining a function or method

#### Front matter
- a section of code that is on top of files with key-values

#### Boolean
- value that is either true or false

#### Square brackets
- [lists and tuples go inside]:

#### For Loop
- used for repeating a sequence

#### Metadata
- a set of data that describes and gives information about other data.

#### Binary
- a coding system using the binary digits 0 and 1 to represent a letter, digit, or other character in a computer or other electronic device. Calculate numbers by using the tens place method.

#### Preprocessing
- A step in the data mining and data analysis process that takes raw data and transforms it into a format (HTML) that can be understood and analyzed by computers and machine learning.

#### Abstraction Process
- Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

#### Liquid
- Code that exits in the programming environment, but gets converted to something else when sent to the browser
