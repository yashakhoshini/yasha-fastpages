The response also does not accurately describe the functionality demonstrated in the video and confuses input and output. Data Abstraction 0 0 Two code segments are provided, one showing storage of data in a list named animalImages, and the other showing another list named animalList. However, animalList is not used in either code segment. The response describes the data contained in animalList, but it also describes the images from animalImages, which are stated to be in the list. Managing Complexity 0 0 The response does not include a program code segment that uses a list to manage complexity. Both code segments show data being stored in a list, but neither contain code using a list. The code is not complex. The response also does not explain how the list manages complexity, it just states that the array allows you to store more than one variable making it shorter and more complex, but it does not explain how it would be written differently without the list. Procedural Abstraction 0 0 The response includes a student-developed procedure called evaluateGuess with one explicit parameter, guess, and a call to this procedure in a second code segment using the argument guess. The response describes the functionality of the procedure as determining if the user's guess is right or wrong. However, the response does not describe how this procedure contributes to the overall functionality of the program. Algorithm Implementation 0 0 The student-developed algorithm within the procedure, evaluateGuess, includes sequencing, iteration (a for loop) and selection (an if statement). The response provides a minimal description of the algorithm, but it does not provide enough detail for someone to recreate it.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Reunion Project Roles</title><link href="https://yashakhoshini.github.io/yasha-fastpages/markdown/reunion%20project/2023/01/16/roles-reunion-project.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reunion Project Roles" /><published>2023-01-16T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://yashakhoshini.github.io/yasha-fastpages/markdown/reunion%20project/2023/01/16/roles-reunion-project</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><category term="reunion project" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Roles and objectives for our reunion project]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Live Stock Data</title><link href="https://yashakhoshini.github.io/yasha-fastpages/markdown/2023/01/16/real-time-stock-data.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Live Stock Data" /><published>2023-01-16T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://yashakhoshini.github.io/yasha-fastpages/markdown/2023/01/16/real-time-stock-data</id><author><name></name></author><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[HTML code that I worked on that utilizes third-party API's and formatting to get live stock data.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Python RapidAPI</title><link href="https://yashakhoshini.github.io/yasha-fastpages/techtalk/rapidapi" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Python RapidAPI" /><published>2023-01-16T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://yashakhoshini.github.io/yasha-fastpages/techtalk/rapid-API</id><author><name></name></author><category term="1.A" /><category term="5.B" /><category term="5.D" /><category term="api" /><category term="rapidapi" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[APIs can be found all over the internet.
