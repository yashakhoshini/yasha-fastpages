github_username: yashakhoshini
# you can comment the below line out if your repo name is not different than your baseurl
github_repo: "yasha-fastpages"

# OPTIONAL: override baseurl and url if using a custom domain
# Note: leave out the trailing / from this value. 
url: "https://yashakhoshini.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com

###########################################################
#########  Special Instructions for baseurl ###############
#
#### Scenario One: If you do not have a Custom Domain #####
#    -  if you are not using a custom domain, the baseurl *must* be set to your repo name
# 
####  Scenario Two: If you have a Custom Domain #####
# 1. If your domain does NOT have a subpath, this leave this value as ""
# 2. If your domain does have a subpath, you must preceed the value with a / and NOT have a / at the end.  
#      For example: 
#           "" is valid
#           "/blog"        is valid
#            "/blog/site/" is invalid  ( / at the end)
#            "/blog/site"  is valid
#            "blog/site"   is invalid  ( because doesn't begin with a /)
#
# 3. You must replace the parameter `baseurl` in _action_files/settings.ini with the same value as you set here but WITHOUT QUOTES.
#

summary: [During the tool setup we learned about all of the things that we would be using during the school year. After that we made our first jupyter notebook and fastpages and also did hacks., We learned a lot of things during the intro to python week. We mainly learned about bash and setting up basic commands  of python. We also learned about setting up work using Bash kernel and establishing PBL habits., Data Abstraction was the main topic in week 2. In the beggining of the week we were shown dictionaries that we had to add our personal information to. The most difficult task for me  was trying to do a for loop with an index, N/A]
