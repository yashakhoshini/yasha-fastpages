    "Idea: simulation game about coding takes place in a virtual city where the player is a software engineer starting a new job. The game involves completing coding challenges to advance in the player's career and help the company succeed. As the player progresses, they are faced with increasingly complex challenges and must manage their time and resources. The game also includes city-building and management elements, where the player's success impacts the virtual city's growth and development."
