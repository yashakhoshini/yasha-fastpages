    "#### Agile Manifesto\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work together during school and at home, the key to our success is communication. If all the [roles]() are defined then it will be easy to get work done. Another key factor that decides whether are project is good or not is time, the more time spent working on coding and brainstorming ideas, the better the outcome. Our motivation to work is obviously to get an A but also to make a running business that generates passive income.\n",

    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For our reunion project we are going to code a website about a tradingview indicator that is used for trading. We are aiming to focus towards wen design and efficency. This website is complemented by code for an indicator that analyzes trends and tells you when to buy and sell a stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How we came across this idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Our team wanted to find a way to apply our personal businesses to APCSP. This business can not only benefit us througout this class but also with money-making. The main aspect we aim to accomplish to exceed APCSP requirements is coding the website as well as the indicator. Along with that, I will utilize that specific code to sell the indicator on whop via tradingview using the apps; discord, tiktok, and instagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is this a good idea?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good idea because I think the point of school is to prepare us for the real world. To me, it's important to use knowledge that was practiced and studied during school in different aspects of human endeavor. In this case, I am making money while learning in school so it's a win-win situation. If one fails, I'll always have the other."
