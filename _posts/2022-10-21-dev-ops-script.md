My name is yasha and I am the Dev Ops manager on my team. At first I had a lot of trouble learning and understanding the role as I made many mistakes. The hardest task for me to complete was deployment, I had trouble adding my repository to the correct directory. I also had trouble understanding the concepts of Nginx and how sites-available and sites-enabled were linked. However after asking around for help and reading tutorials I was better able to understand how nginx files work off of each other. Both files are linked to each other meaning whenever a change is made to sites-enabled, it will update to sites-available. This is efficent because it doesn't require you to update both files. The running application runs the code in the project directory and is held in the docker container. What helped me understand deployment better was thinking of it as a box. Docker is the box that contains your running application and Nginx is the window on the box that reveals it to the internet.

Another aspect of Dev Ops is understanding your tools. Github is a file-hosting cloud that allows teams to work on the same project. Docker lets you run the application, your application is your website. An IDE otherwise known as an interactive developer environment is a code editor, in our case, vscode.

To summarize, I think that Dev Ops is one of the hardest roles to master and at first I didn't think I was the correct person for it however as time went on I realized that Dev Ops is an opportunity for me to acquire learning skills from different concepts. I still would like to learn more about Nginx and IDE's.
