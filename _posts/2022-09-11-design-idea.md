# My quiz plan:
 
-  Create a quiz about chelsea that has questions that have specific answers that need to be typed and submitted
-  Brainstorm & learn about how code.org works
-  Create: use what I know to start it by myself then get help if needed
-  Finalize: After creating the quiz, review it and run it myself to check and make sure its accurate

# Drafting:
 
For my code it was challenging for me to use an if statement to help me code a question that requires typing and submitting but I figured it out.

here is the code:
    onEvent("button3", "click", function( ) {
	console.log("answerbutton entered text: " + getText("text_input3"));
	if (getText("text_input3") == "1905") {
	  setScreen("question3");
	} else {
	  setScreen("incorrectpage");
 
# Data Abstraction
 
An example of Data Abstraction in this program is the "font size" chart. It holds multiple selections that represent different sizes. A random number function takes a random size selection from the list and sets the default font size to that selection.
 
# The point
 
 The point of the assignment was to get comfortable with code.org but specifically java script.
 
 # Managing Complexity
 
 An example of complexity management in this quiz is the layout. The quiz is divided into two parts: pasword and exploration in the program. This can easily be seen in the first part of the code, each command has its own defined function.
