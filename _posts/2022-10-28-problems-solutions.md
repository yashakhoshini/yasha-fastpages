Problem 1: Over these past few weeks I spent most of my time doing DevOps work, I didn't really understand much at first and as time went on I only learned a tiny bit.

Solution 1: However yesterday, One of my friends helped me understand commands and specific concepts better. After that, I was able to finally deploy my website, I technically had it deployed before but it was just the wrong repository.


As of now, we are working on our API for the project. Specifically we are generating a new API and adding it into vscode. Our idea was to make an API that asks people for their reviews on our products (shirts, shorts, crewnecks, etc).op
