         <td>The stated goal of the program is to allow users to view animals and recognize them later, it mentions the underlying issue or artistic motivation behind it which was good. However, the description provided does not match the functionality shown in the video and conflates the input and output.</td>

         <td>Two code snippets are presented, one that demonstrates how data is stored in the list "animalImages", and another that depicts the list "animalList". However, the "animalList" is not used in either of the code snippets. The explanation provided mentions the content of "animalList" but also includes details about the images from "animalImages" which are stated to be in that list.</td>

         <td>0</td>
         <td>The provided response includes two code segments that demonstrate the efficient storage of data in a list named "animalImages" and "animalList". This effectively utilizes the capability of a list to store multiple variables in a shorter and more organized manner, thus simplifying the overall complexity of the code. Furthermore, the response explains the practical application of using a list to manage complexity and how it streamlines the overall program structure.</td>

         <td>The response features a student-created function named "evaluateGuess" that takes in one input, "guess" and demonstrates its usage in a separate code snippet. The function is described as determining the accuracy of the user's guess. However, it does not elaborate on how this function fits into the larger picture and contributes to the overall functionality of the program.</td>

         <td>0</td>
         <td>The "evaluateGuess" function created by the student, includes elements of sequencing, iteration (using a for loop) and selection (utilizing an if statement) within the algorithm. The explanation provided gives a brief overview of the algorithm, but it lacks sufficient detail to allow someone to replicate it.</td>
