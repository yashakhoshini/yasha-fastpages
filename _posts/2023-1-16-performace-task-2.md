This effectively utilizes the capability of a list to store multiple variables in a shorter and more organized manner, thus simplifying the overall complexity of the code. Furthermore, the response explains the practical application of using a list to manage complexity and how it streamlines the overall program structure.</td>

Storing noun inputs in separate variables and calling them individually would have resulted in more readable code. Furthermore, using a different method, such as generating a random integer, to randomize selection would have been more efficient and resulted in less cluttered code, rather than having to write multiple statements for each possible integer generated.</td>

The response explains the poorly designed algorithm, it starts by defining a variable to count the number of poems generated and then defines an empty string, then it has an iteration that tries to generate as many poems as the user specified by running through the selection statements, which call articlePoem or noArticlePoem each time. However, it is not clear how these steps are organized and how the algorithm is supposed to work.</td>

The algorithm iterates through the list of each character, sums up the rankings, and divides by 6 to get the average, but it is not clear how these steps are organized. It then compares the averages using a conditional statement to determine the winner and display their name and image on the winner screen, but this approach is not efficient.</td>
